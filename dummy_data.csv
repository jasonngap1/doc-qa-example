Absolutely stunning plate of seafood bee hoon!,"From the fresh, succulent and thick fish slices, to the charring of the bee hoon and ingredients to an amazingly robust seafood broth, it had it all. Each mouthful of the bee hoon and soup just shouts flavour, due to the huge amount of umami and smokey flavour. Love the fresh crispy pork lard as well!
The portion came pretty big too! Really extremely worth it and I can't wait to come back to have another plate of this!",https://abc.xyz/review1,5,ABC Beehoon,https://abc.xyz/1,~$10/pax,"Hawker Food

Good food and wines,"The Short Ribs Galbi really stole the show for me. Tender and extremely flavourful, the galbi pieces were also very smokey. The sweet and savoury marinade further enhanced the flavour profile as well!",https://abc.xyz/review2,5,New Place Seafood House,https://abc.xyz/2,~$50/pax,"Zi Char

Lovely sandwiches and sides!,"A relatively new cafe serving up superb sandwiches and sides!
We ordered a couple sandwiches, but I have to give an honourable mention to their Patty Melts ($17) sandwich. Juicy, beefy patty topped with savoury cheese and dijon mustard sauce and sandwiched between crispy grilled sandwich bread, this is one wholesome meal. There is so much going on I can't help but smile after eating this!
You can add on some sides to the sandwiches (+$5) and we tried their curly fries, onion rings and fried brussel sprouts. All were very well executed, but the fried brussel sprouts took the show with the good smoky flavour with minimal bitterness. Absolutely lovely.
Coffee is alright, the Iced White ($5.50) was not too milky and was quite strong.
I definitely will come back again!",https://abc.xyz/review3,4,Sando Place,https://abc.xyz/3,~$15/pax,"Breakfast & Brunch

So many lovely dishes that were well executed!,"What a spread! The Gyoza set ($13.90) comes with 5 gyozas, 2 side dishes, a soup, a bowl of rice and unlimited refills of seasoned bean sprouts and pickled vegetables. Really worth it!
Everything we had were executed really well. The gyozas were very meaty and juicy, perfect with the yuzu ponzu sauce. As for the side dishes, I especially loved the Eggplant and pork slices stir fried with miso, and the nanban chicken.
The Eggplant and pork slices were all very tender, and we loved how miso gave so much umami and flavour!
The nanban chicken was hot, crispy, so tender and succulent and perfect with the mayo sauce. This is highly addictive.
Really such a satisfying meal! We had nothing but compliments for all the dishes. Definitely will be back!",https://abc.xyz/review4,5,Dumpling King,https://abc.xyz/4,~$20/pax,Japanese
Not bad of a coffee!,"A quaint coffee place in the heart of Chinatown, Plus Coffee Joint offers coffee with multiple coffee bean options.
I got their Latte ($5.50). Not too milky, it was a strong brew and you can taste some chocolate and hazelnut notes. Not bad of a coffee! However, I do wish that there were less ice in the cup as it watered down the coffee quite quickly ??
Will be back to try their Dirty, which is quite rare to find in Singapore!",https://abc.xyz/review5,2,Coffee House,https://abc.xyz/5,~$5/pax,Cafes & Coffee
Lovely thick fish slices!,"What's there to not love from a good bowl of fish soup? Fish Soup Ban Mian allows you to put in handmade noodles into your fish soup, which is lovely!
I had the Double Fish Soup with Ban Mian ($5.50) and it came generous with thick fresh fish slices. The fish slices were so firm, bouncy and sweet, so satisfying! The soup was robust in flavour and had a strong fish stock taste. Together with the chewy handmade noodles, this hearty bowl definitely made me smile!",https://abc.xyz/review6,5,Fish Soup Ban Mian,https://abc.xyz/6,~$5/pax,Hawker Food
